It's like underwatter fog. It's behavior is changing pixel color into desired fog-color depending on distance from camera

In your scene file, add this directly into scene:

  <Fog type="exp2" val1="0.04">
  	<Color red="0.3" green="0.8" blue="0.98"/>
  </Fog>
  
  OR
  
  <Fog type="linear" val1="10.0" val2="20.0">
  	<Color red="0.3" green="0.8" blue="0.98"/>
  </Fog>
  
  
  * type - 3 possibilities "linear" "exp" "exp2"
         - it is changing how your scattering/fog will behave (you can experiment)
         
  * val1 - 1. for "exp" and "exp2" function, density parameter, which is changing shape of function
           2. for "linear", it is bottom treshold -> from which distance is fog starting to appear
           
  * val2 - only for "linear", it sets upper distance from camera, when everything is completely foggy
  
  * Color - color of your fog
          - it also changes color of background of your window
  
  ==>> Experiment with color and functions and parameters, to get the ,most suitable result for you
  ==>> Enable/Disable fog by pressing 'T' Key (scaTering) and moving the scene
